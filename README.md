# Project
Stroke Prediction
In this code we have processed the stroke data. First we loaded the data via kaggle, then we processed the data one by one via histplot, piechart, boxplot, kdeplot. Beyza did the first 3 parts. The other 4 parts were made by Zeren and the last 4 parts by Ertuğrul. Then we saw that BMi had NaN values and Beyza assigned median values to NaN values. It was empty because NaN values were not entered. Then Beyza changed the properties ever_married, Residence_type, smoking_status, gender and work_type to values 0 1 because it was required for machine learning.

For the machine learning phase, Beyza dedicated their time to developing the XGBoost and Decision98
Tree models. Similarly, Zeren focused on constructing the Random Forest model, while Ertu ̆grul99
utilized Logistic Regression. Once each member completed their respective models, we integrated100
them into a unified whole. The process concluded when all three team members reached a consensus101
on the findings and presented them in the report.Finally, we analyzed that XGBoost gives the best results.
