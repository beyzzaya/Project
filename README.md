# Project
Stroke Prediction
In this code i had processed the stroke data. First i loaded the data via kaggle, then i processed the data one by one via histplot, piechart, boxplot, kdeplot.Then i saw that BMi had NaN values and assigned median values to NaN values. It was empty because NaN values were not entered. Then i changed the properties ever_married, Residence_type, smoking_status, gender and work_type to values 0 1 because it was required for machine learning.

For the machine learning phase, I dedicated my time to developing the XGBoost and Decision
Tree models. Similarly, and i focused on constructing the Random Forest model, and then i
utilized Logistic Regression. I integrated them into a unified whole. The process concluded and i fond and presented them in the report. Finally, i analyzed that XGBoost gives the best results.
